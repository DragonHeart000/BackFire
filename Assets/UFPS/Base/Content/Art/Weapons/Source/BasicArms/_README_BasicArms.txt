About these files:

- New version of the original arm source content, with both arms, rigged.

- May be combined with your own weapon models in many popular art packages.

- Formats:

    FBX
      Updated arm mesh (two arms) with a weighted skeleton. Create some constraints and add some controls in your software of choice and you are good to go animating.

    LXO (in *.zip file, Modo specific)
      Updated arm mesh (two arms) with a simple rig for modo in lxo format. Skin-weighted and full body IK with goals assigned. Animating with the Pose-tool in Modo works like a charm.

- Note that the demo scenes currently use an older, non-rigged, single arm model.
